Why this project ?

I like to have a usb disk where I store my development environment (Eclipse and projects sources), so I can work on every computer. Sometimes, the computer I am using does not have an internet connection (even if it's rare nowadays). But when it occurs, there's no way to retrieve project dependencies.

To avoid this situation, I often copy project dependencies in a specific folder, keeping the repository layout, so I always have dependencies on my usb disk. By exposing this folder over HTTP, and adding this local repository in the project pom, Maven retrieve successfully the required dependencies. Cool.



The server is developped by Paul James Mutton (http://www.jibble.org/miniwebserver/). Thanks to him.
